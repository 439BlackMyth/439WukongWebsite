    <h3>I. Course Description &amp; Objectives 课程描述与目标:</h3>
    <p>
      China's 3A game "Black Myth: Wukong" (黑神话: 悟空) became a global sensation 
      after its launch on August 20, 2024. The game captivated gamers worldwide with its 
      stunning visuals and profound reinterpretation of the classic Chinese novel "Journey to 
      the West" (西游记). This novel tells the story of Tang Sanzang (唐三藏) and his 
      disciples, Sun Wukong (孙悟空), Zhu Bajie (猪八戒), and Sha Wujing (沙悟净), as they 
      journey westward to obtain Buddhist scriptures, overcoming 81 trials along the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      This course explores Chinese culture, literature, and language through both the video 
      game "Black Myth: Wukong" and the novel "Journey to the West." The course 
      includes an introduction to "Black Myth: Wukong" and its societal impact, examining the 
      game's development, reception, and cultural significance both in China and globally. It 
      also involves a close reading of the novel "Journey to the West" as a cornerstone of 
      Chinese literature, with analysis of key selections, discussion of its historical value and 
      modern influence. Additionally, a comparative analysis of the novel and game explores 
      their relationship, highlighting similarities and differences in character creation, and 
      discussing cultural inheritance and innovation. Through these explorations, students will 
      enhance their understanding of Chinese culture and history while improving their 
      Chinese language proficiency.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Learning Outcomes 学习成果:</strong></p>
    <p>At the end of the course, students are expected to be able to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>understand the Chinese culture, literature, and language topics covered in the 
      video game "Black Myth: Wukong" and the novel "Journey to the West."</li>
      <li>analyze various cultural aspects, practices, comparisons and influence of both 
      works</li>
      <li>pursue their own interests and create some innovative work to share with others</li>

    <h3>Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI)</h3>
    <p>
      Department of Modern Languages' Statement on Diversity, Equity, Justice,  
      and Inclusion<br>
      The Department of Modern Languages, a unique space in which humanistic and 
      linguistic research and teaching intersect, is firmly committed to building a community 
      that is radically inclusive of people of all backgrounds while simultaneously recognizing 
      the inherent social, personal, political, and institutional racism pervasive in higher 
      education. We commit, as individuals and as a department, to actively engage in research 
      and teaching practices that prioritize social justice, and are anti-racist, anti-sexist and 
      anti-discriminatory of LGBTQ people. In doing so, we strive to provide a safe, respectful 
      environment that promotes the success of all individuals, and that fosters a space for 
      dialogue.
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not tolerate harassment, discrimination or disrespect. In our role as researchers 
      and teachers in the Humanities and Social Sciences, we believe that it is central to our 
      work to document, interrogate, and challenge societies and social relationships, and the 
      structures of power and systems of oppression that discriminate against and inflict 
      multiple forms of violence upon certain groups. We carry out this work through a critical, 
      historical and contemporary analysis of language, texts, films, and other cultural 
      processes and products. Through our work as humanists, social scientists, and linguists, 
      we aim to promote a better understanding of how these systems operate and intersect 
      across time and in different cultures in order to denounce inequality and to create a more 
      just society for all, locally and globally.

    <!-- Accommodations for Disabilities -->
    <h3>Accommodations for Disabilities</h3>
    <p>
      If you have a disability and are registered with the Office of Disability Resources, 
      I encourage you to use their online system to notify me of your accommodations and 
      discuss your needs with me as early in the semester as possible. I will work with you to 
      ensure that accommodations are provided as appropriate. If you suspect that you may 
      have a disability and would benefit from accommodations but are not yet registered with

    <!-- Academic Integrity -->
    <h3>Academic Integrity</h3>
    <p>
      Students who copy assignments, allow assignments to be copied, or cheat on 
      essays/tests/projects will fail the assignment on the first offense and fail the entire course 
      on the second. I will also contact Student Affairs on the first offense and have them 
      decide whether a Review Board hearing is necessary. I take this responsibility very 
      seriously. If you are caught cheating, I will report your behavior to Student Affairs. If you 
      are unsure about your particular situation, please ask me for clarification before you turn 
      in an assignment as your own work. I encourage you to be aware of these policies for all 
      of your courses and faculty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Except for situations in which you will be working with a partner or in groups, 
      you are expected to do your own work. Any compromise of academic integrity will not 
      be tolerated and will result in failure of the exercise and possibly the entire course, and 
      possibly suspension or expulsion from the university. Any written or exercise help given 
      by the assistant must be noted in a visible place on the work. If you have questions, speak 
      to me or visit:

    <h3>Health &amp; Well-being</h3>
    <p>
      Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle and take care of yourself by eating 
      well, exercising, avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep, and taking some time 
      to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. There are many helpful 
      resources available on campus and an important part of the college experience is learning 
      how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is almost always helpful.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, 
      or feelings like anxiety or depression, I strongly encourage you to seek support. 
      Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) can help: call 412-268-2922 and visit 
      their website at 
      <a href=\"http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/</a>. 
      Consider reaching out to a friend, faculty or family member whom you trust for help 
      getting connected to support. Other support networks on campus include; Re: solve Crisis 
      Network: 888-796-8226, CMU Police: 412-268-2323 (on campus); 911 (off campus)

    <!-- Use of Mobile Devices -->
    <h3>Use of Mobile Devices, Laptops, Phones, etc.</h3>
    <p>
      As research on learning shows, unexpected noises and movements automatically divert 
      and capture people's attention, which means you are affecting everyone’s learning 
      experience if your cell phone, pager, laptop, etc. makes noise or is visually distracting 
      during class. I would prefer that you not have any devices with you. So please, if you 
      must,
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>turn off your mobile devices and close your laptops during class;</li>
      <li>if you take notes or refer to notes on your laptop during class, turn the sound off so that 
      you do not disrupt other students' learning;</li>
      <li>if you intend to do anything other than working for the class on your laptop, reconsider 
      coming to class.</li>
